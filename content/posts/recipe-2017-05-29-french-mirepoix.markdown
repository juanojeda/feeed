id: "VJ8olkKY7"
blurb: "Mirepoix is a French staple, and the basis for basically every French recipe. Some simple substitutions and additions can yield the base for whole new cuisines. For example, substitute butter for olive oil, and add some garlic and parsley, and you've got the base for many Italian recipes."

1. Melt butter in a heavy-based saucepan or frying pan over a medium-high heat. You're looking for small bubbles, but you don't want to burn the butter.
2. Once the butter is ready, add the onions and fry until fragrant and translucent. Stir them occasionally, so that they don't stick to the base of the pan.
3. Throw in the carrots and the celery. Keep stirring occasionally.
4. (Optional) Add some finely chopped parsley, for a bit of an aromatic kick.
5. When the mix softened (but not mushy!) and aromatic, it's ready for use in your soup, stew, stock or other recipes.
